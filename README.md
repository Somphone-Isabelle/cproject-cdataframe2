The goal of this project is to create a CDataFrame.
For an intermediate filling, we choose to focus on the basics functions in order to be comfortable and comprehend the subject in deep.
So in order to do, we first create an colomn.c and colomn.h file that allow us to manage the functions around the column thanks to the structure of the column.

Then next, we created a cdataframe.c and a cdataframe.h that will have all the main functions that are the fondation of the project and that will be use for the functionalities that will called in main.c thanks to a menu.
